# I. Project Overview

This tracker enables users to keep track of their weekly spending, increasing awareness of their spending patterns and encouraging responsible financial management. Using the 50/30/20 rule, it assists users in managing spending by allowing them to log each purchase and immediately subtract it from their weekly budget. At the end of the week, users can analyze data that shows their spending habits, which can provide beneficial insights for future budgeting.
